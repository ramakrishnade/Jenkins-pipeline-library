•	docker exec
•	docker stop
•	docker kill
•	docker commit

•	docker rmi
•	docker build
•	Docker copy
•	Docker history
•	Docker logout
•	Docker logs
•	Docker network
•	Docker restart
•	Docker search
•	Docker volume

So, let’s get started:
Docker Commands
1. docker –version
This command is used to get the currently installed version of docker
 
 
2. docker pull
Usage: docker pull <image name>
This command is used to pull images from the docker repository(hub.docker.com)
 

3. docker run
Usage: docker run -it -d <image name>
This command is used to create a container from an image
 

4. docker ps
This command is used to list the running containers
 

5. docker ps -a
This command is used to show all the running and exited containers
 

6. docker exec
Usage: docker exec -it <container id> bash
This command is used to access the running container
 
7. docker stop
Usage: docker stop <container id>
This command stops a running container
 


8. docker kill
Usage: docker kill <container id>
This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately. The difference between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’ is that ‘docker stop’ gives the container time to shutdown gracefully, in situations when it is taking too much time for getting the container to stop, one can opt to kill it
 

9. docker commit
Usage: docker commit <conatainer id> <username/imagename>
This command creates a new image of an edited container on the local system
 

10. docker login
This command is used to login to the docker hub repository
 

11. docker push
Usage: docker push <username/image name>
This command is used to push an image to the docker hub repository
 

12. docker images
This command lists all the locally stored docker images
 

13. docker rm
Usage: docker rm <container id>
This command is used to delete a stopped container
 

14. docker rmi
Usage: docker rmi <image-id>
This command is used to delete an image from local storage
 

15. docker build
Usage: docker build <path to docker file>
This command is used to build an image from a specified docker file
 
 Docker copy
Usage: COPY <source_file> <destination_directory>
This command copies files or directories from the host machine’s file system to the container’s file system during Docker image construction.
17.	Docker history
Usage: docker history <image_name>
Using this command, you may examine the evolution of a Docker image or its constituent parts.
18.	Docker Logout 
Usage: docker logout [REGISTRY_URL]
This command is used to log out or remove the credentials used to authenticate with a Docker registry. 
19.	Docker logs
Usage: docker logout [REGISTRY_URL]
This command is used to log out of a Docker registry or to delete the credentials used to login with it. 
20.	Docker network
Usage: docker network create <network_name>
This command manages Docker networks. Docker networks enable containers to connect securely and isolatedly with one another and with external network resources.
21.	Docker restart
Usage: docker restart [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER…]
This command is used to restart one or more Docker containers that are currently operating. Restarting a container entails gently pausing it and then restarting it with the same configuration and parameters. 
22.	Docker search
Usage: docker search [OPTIONS] TERM
This command searches for Docker images on Docker Hub, a public registry for Docker images.
23.	Docker volume
Usage: docker volume create my_volume
This command creates a new Docker volume named “my_volume” in the Docker container. Volumes in Docker are generated independently of containers.
